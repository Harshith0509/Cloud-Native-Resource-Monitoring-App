# Cloud-Native-Resource-Monitoring-App
A lightweight Flask application that exposes real-time CPU and memory usage metrics via a RESTful /metrics endpoint. Designed for cloud-native environments, this app is Dockerized, published to AWS ECR, and deployed on Amazon EKS.

Perfect for demonstrating end-to-end containerized deployments using Flask, Docker, ECR, and EKS, this project serves as a simple yet powerful template for building and scaling microservices in the cloud.
